**Further Development**
- Enhance user interface (UI) with HTML and CSS.
- Implement location search functionality (e.g., using a form or API endpoint).
Display additional weather details (humidity, wind speed, etc.).
- Explore Django features like forms, templating, and views for a more interactive and user-friendly experience.
- Consider error handling and edge cases for a robust application.
